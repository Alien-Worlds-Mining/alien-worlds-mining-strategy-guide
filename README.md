## 👽 What is Alien Worlds?

Alien Worlds is a cross-chain Play-to-Earn game powered by WAX and BNB Smart Chain. Players use mining tools to extract Trilium (TLM), the in-game currency, from various planets.

Players can mine land (owned by others or themselves), earn TLM tokens, stake to planets for governance, and send NFTs on missions to earn rewards.

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside This Guide

- ✅ Tool & land synergy: find the best combinations for mining speed or yield
- ✅ Planet staking & governance overview
- ✅ NFT missions: send avatars or minions for passive rewards
- ✅ How to earn TLM with minimum time spent
- ✅ Bonus: Use CPU/RAM efficiently on WAX for faster mining

---

## 🧩 Core Mechanics

- ⛏ Tools: Each tool has charge time, yield, NFT luck, and delay
- 🌍 Planets: Choose between Naron, Magor, Eyeke, Kavian, Veles, Neri for varied rewards
- 🧬 Land Types: Volcano, Tundra, Ice, etc — each boosts different stats
- 🪙 Trilium (TLM): Earned from mining or staking; tradable token
- 🛰 Missions: Send NFTs to complete missions on BNB chain (passive yield)

---

## 🎯 Tips & Mining Secrets

- 🧮 Triple-tool loadouts matter — combine 1 heavy-yield tool + 2 light-speed tools for balance
- 🌋 Volcano & Ice lands are ideal for TLM if paired with power drills
- 💼 Stake TLM to your favorite planet to increase mining share
- 📦 Use tools with high NFT Luck to get rare tools or minions while mining
- 🧠 Avoid tools with long charge time unless you mine only once a day
